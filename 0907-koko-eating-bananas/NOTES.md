Time Complexity: O(m.log(n)) - Binary search takes O(log N) iterations. If piles has m elements, each iteration involves a feasibility check which takes O(m) time.

1. 'left' is initialized to 1 because the minimum speed must be at least '1' banana per hour.
2. 'right' is initialized to 'Integer.MAX_VALUE' because this sets an upper bound on the possible eating speed.
3. The loop continues until the range is narrowed down to one possible value for left.
4. mid is calculated as the average of left and right. This is the candidate eating speed being tested.
5. Check if Koko can eat all the bananas at speed mid within h hours.
6. If yes, it means mid might be the minimum speed, but there could be a smaller speed that also works. So, adjust right to mid to continue searching in the lower half. If no, it means mid is too slow. So, adjust left to mid + 1 to search in the upper half.
7. 'canEatInTime' method checks if Koko can eat all the bananas at a given speed k within h hours.
8. Initialize hours: Start with 0 hours.
9. Iterate Over Piles: For each pile, calculate the hours required to eat all bananas in that pile at speed k.
10. This calculation uses ceiling division to ensure that any remaining bananas are accounted for (i.e., eating 1 banana per hour if any are left).
11. If at any point the accumulated hours exceed h, return false immediately to optimize the search.
12. After iterating through all piles, return whether the total hours is within h.
13. After the binary search loop completes, left will hold the minimum eating speed required for Koko to finish all the bananas within h hours.
