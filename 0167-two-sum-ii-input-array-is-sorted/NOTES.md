Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

1) Set a_pointer to the start of the array, i.e., index 0. Set b_pointer to the end of the array, i.e., index len(numbers) - 1.
2) Enter a while loop that continues until the a_pointer is less than or equal to the b_pointer.
3) Calculate the sum of the elements at indices a_pointer and b_pointer in the numbers array and store it in the variable sum.
4) If the sum is greater than the target, decrement b_pointer. This indicates that we need to decrease the sum, so we move towards smaller values by decreasing the index of the b_pointer.
5) If the sum is less than the target, increment a_pointer. This indicates that we need to increase the sum, so we move towards larger values by increasing the index of the a_pointer.
6) If the sum value is the same as target, return an array containing the indices a_pointer + 1 and b_pointer + 1. These indices are incremented by 1 to convert them to 1-indexed format as mentioned in the problem statement.
7) Repeat these steps until either the condition a_pointer <= b_pointer becomes false, or a valid pair summing up to the target is found. If no valid pair summing up to the target is found within the array, return an empty array.
