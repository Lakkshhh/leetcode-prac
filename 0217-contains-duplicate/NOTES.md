Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

1) **Choose Methodology**: I had to decide between sorting the array and comparing adjacent elements or using a HashSet. For this explanation, let's focus on the HashSet approach.
2) **Create a HashSet**: Instantiate a HashSet to store unique elements.
3) **Iterate Over the Array**: Start iterating over the array.
4) **Check for Duplicate**: Inside the loop, for each element, check if the HashSet already contains the element.
5) **Handle Duplicate**: If the element is already in the HashSet, return true immediately, indicating the presence of a duplicate.
6) **Add to HashSet**: If the element is not in the HashSet, add it to the HashSet.
7) **Loop Completion**: After iterating through all elements in the array, if no duplicates are found, exit the loop.
8) **Return Result**: Return false to indicate that all elements are unique.
